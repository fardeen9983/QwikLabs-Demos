# Compute Engine : Windows server
Google Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that allows you to easily launch large compute clusters on Google's infrastructure.

We can create Windows instances using Compute Engine and connect to it using remote desktop connection and make use of all the features it offers.

Create an intance in the GCP with Boot image set to Windows server variant with desktop experience. wait for some time for Windos instance to boot up

Run following commang to check if initial  scripts are finished running
```
gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output instance-1 --zone us-central1-a
```
If the output is
```
Finished running startup scripts.
```
then we are good to go

Setup password for the windows insatnce by clicking on the instance name and selecting **Set Windows Password**. A username will automatically be generated.

## Connect to the instance using Remote Desktop Protocol
In the instance field click on RDP. You can use windows RDC tool using the downloaded RDP file or set up one as a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-rdp-for-google-clo/mpbbnannobiobpnfblimoapbephgifkm)

Once Window's Server manager starts up all is set.
