[Managed contanerized apps with GKE](https://youtu.be/u9nsngvmMK4)

Google Kubernete enignes provides a fast and effective way for managing containers across GCP. It is combined form of many Google machines which together form a cloud cluster.

**What will you do**
* Create containers
* Deploy applications with GKE

## Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open source cluster management system that powers GKE and provides methods to access the cloud clusters. It can deploy and manage applications, perform admin tasks, [logging and monitoring workloads](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/logging), [automatic scaling](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/cluster-autoscaler)
, [rolling updates](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrade), [load balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling), [node auto repair](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair), [node pooling](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-pools) etc. 

## Creating a cluster
1. Create a container cluster
    ```
    gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME]
    ```
    The cluster will be created with properties as :
    * NAME
    * LOCATION (Zone)
    * MASTER_VERSION
    * MASTER_IP
    * MACHINE_TYPE
    * NODE_VERSION
    * NUM_NODES
    * STATUS
2. Fetch cluster credentials to interact with it.
    ```
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME]
    ```
    It generates and adds a **kubeconfig** entry for the cluster.
3. Deploy application to the cluster
    *   Kubernetes encapsulates applications and resources into kubernete objects to manage them 
    * The **Deplpoyment** object is used for deplying web servers and other stateless applications
    * **Service** objects define the rules and load-balancing for accessing applications across internet.
    * Kubernete commands : kubectl
        * Command for running an app in the cluster
            ```
            kubectl run [APP_SERVER_NAME] --image=[APP_IMAGE] --port [PORT_NO]
            ```
            This command will create a deployment for the given app

            APP_SERVER_NAME will become the name of the deployment
            --image refers to the application's container image. You can pull one from the [Google Container Registry (gcr)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs) or from Docker registry, etc
        * Now create a service to access this application by exposing it's deployment
            ```
            kubectl expose deployment [DEPLOYMENT_NAME] --type="LoadBalancer"
            ```
        * Fetch service details
            ```
            kubectl get service [SERVICE_NAME]
            ```
            The various fields of the service we get are:
            * NAME
            * TYPE
            * CLUSTER-IP
            * EXTERNAL-IP
            * PORT(S)
            * AGE

            We can access the service through:  
            ```url
            https://external-IP:port
            ```
## Deleting a cluster
```
gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER-NAME]
```
