# Getting started with Network and HTTP load balancers

[Set Up Network & HTTP Load Balancers, GCP Essentials](https://youtu.be/1ZW59HrRUzw)

**What will you do**
* Differentiate a network and HTTP load balancer
* Setup L3 [Network load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
and L7 [HTTP load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/) 

## Create mutilple web server instances
*   Create simple cluster of NGINX web servers to server static content using:
    * [Instance Templates](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates) : Define the look of VM in cluster (disk, CPUs, memory, etc)
    * [Managed Instance Groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/) : Using the Insatnce Template create mutilple VM instances
* Steps :
    1.  A startup script for every VM to setup NGINX in the cloud shell
    2. An instance template to use the startup script
    3. A target pool of nodes
    4. A managed instance group created using the Instance template
* Startup script : startup.sh
    ```
    #! /bin/bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y nginx
    service nginx start
    sed -i -- 's/nginx/Google Cloud Platform - '"\$HOSTNAME"'/' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
    EOF
    ```
* Create an instance template
    ```
    gcloud compute instance-templates create [INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME] \ --meta-data-from-file startup-script=[STARTUP_SCRIPT]
    ```
* Create a target pool which will give access to all instances in a group. Also necessary for load-balancing
    ```
    gcloud compute target-pools create [TARGET_POOL_NAME]
    ```
* Creat a managed instance group from the created instance-template
    ```
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed create [MANAGED_GROUP_NAME] \
         --base-instance-name [BASE_INSTANCE_NAME] \
         --size 2 \
         --template [INSTANCE_TEMPLARE] \
         --target-pool [TARGET_POOL]
    ```
* List all the created instances
    ```
    gcloud compute instances list 
    ```
* Configure firewall rules for instance groups to allow HTTP calls
    ```
    gcloud compute firewall-rules create [FIREWALL_RULE_NAME] --allow tcp:80
    ```

##  [Setting up Network Load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
Network load balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data, such as address, port, and protocol type. You also get some options that are not available, with HTTP(S) load balancing. For example, you can load balance additional TCP/UDP-based protocols such as SMTP traffic. And if your application is interested in TCP-connection-related characteristics, network load balancing allows your app to inspect the packets, where HTTP(S) load balancing does not.

* Create an L3 network load balancer targeting your instance group
    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create [LOAD_BALANCER_NAME] \
         --region [ZONE] \
         --ports=[PORT_NOS] \
         --target-pool [TARGET_POOL]
    ```
* List all the forwarding rules
    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
    ```
* You can then visit the load balancer from the browser http://IP_ADDRESS/ where IP_ADDRESS is the address shown as the result of running the previous command.

## [Create a HTTP(s) Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/)
HTTP(S) load balancing provides global load balancing for HTTP(S) requests destined for your instances. You can configure URL rules that route some URLs to one set of instances and route other URLs to other instances. Requests are always routed to the instance group that is closest to the user, provided that group has enough capacity and is appropriate for the request. If the closest group does not have enough capacity, the request is sent to the closest group that does have capacity.

* Create a health check to verify that the instance is responding to HTTP or HTTPS traffic:
    ```
    gcloud compute http-health-checks create [HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK_NAME]
    ```
* Define an HTTP service and map a port name to the relevant port for the instance group. Now the load balancing service can forward traffic to the named port:
    ```
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed \
       set-named-ports [MANAGED_GROUP] \
       --named-ports http:80
    ```
* Create a [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/backendServices):
    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services create [BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME] \
      --protocol HTTP --http-health-checks [HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK] --global
    ```
* Add the instance group into the backend service:
    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services add-backend [BACKEND_SERVICE] \
    --instance-group [MANAGED_GROUP] \
    --instance-group-zone [ZONE] \
    --global
    ```
* Create a default URL map that directs all incoming requests to all your instances:
    ```
    gcloud compute url-maps create [URL_MAP_NAME] \
    --default-service [BACKEND_SERVICE]
    ```
    To direct traffic to different instances based on the URL being requested, see [content-based routing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/content-based-example).

* Create a target HTTP proxy to route requests to your URL map:
    ```
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies create [HTTP_PROXY_NAME] \
    --url-map [URL_MAP]
    ```
* Create a global forwarding rule to handle and route incoming requests. A forwarding rule sends traffic to a specific target HTTP or HTTPS proxy depending on the IP address, IP protocol, and port specified. The global forwarding rule does not support multiple ports.
    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules create [FORWARDING_RULE_NAME] \
        --global \
        --target-http-proxy [HTTP_PROXY] \
        --ports 80
    ```
* List out the forwarding rules
    ```
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
    ```
